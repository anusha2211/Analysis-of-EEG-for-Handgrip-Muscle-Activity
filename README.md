# Analysis-of-EEG-for-Handgrip-Muscle-Activity
This project presents an age-wise Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis for different hand grip muscle activities. The experiment aims towards aiding the development of devices such as prosthetic arms that establish a link between the generated EEG signal and the muscle for activity.
